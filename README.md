# cordex-cmip6_wrf-users_base

This is the base repository for the CORDEX-CMIP6 coordinated WRF runs started in 2021. 

It may contain, also in different git branches, everything (=namelists, TBL, files, cookbooks, documentation etc.) to create static fields and forcing data and to run WRF for the CORDEX-CMIP6 evaluation, historical, and projeciton runs according go the CORDEX-CMIP6 protocol as of 2021. The maste rbranch should alsoways contain the most recent community-agreed upon configuration.

When CORDEX-CMIP6 further differentiates itself into more subprojects then more repositories might be created within the gitlab subgroup cordex-cmip6. 

For more information, until this README.md file of the base repository for the CORDEX-CMIP6 WRF runs has been updated, see the README.md file of the FPSCONV D-experiments as part of this private gitlab CORDEX group: https://gitlab.com/cordex/cordex-fpsconv/cordex-fpsconv_wrf-users_exp-d/-/blob/master/README.md
