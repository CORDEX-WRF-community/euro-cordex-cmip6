## ECMWF ERA5 r1i1p1f1

The evaluation run uses ERA5.1 obtained from the CDS at 6h frequency on model levels. GHG evolution beyond 2014 follows the SSP3-7.0 path, according to the EURO-CORDEX CMIP6 simulation protocol.

## CMCC CMCC-CM2-SR5 r1i1p1f1

## MPI MPI-ESM1-2-HR r1i1p1f1

## NCC NorESM2-MM r1i1p1f1

NorESM2-MM boundary data was obtained in-house from the NIRD node and interpolated to 38 pressure levels. Data are 6-hourly, but for the historical experiment they are saved at 03, 09, 15 and 21h, instead of the 0, 6, 12, 18h in the scenarios.
