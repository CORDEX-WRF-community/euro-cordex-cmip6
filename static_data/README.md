# Static data in WRF-CORDEX-EUR-11 simulations

This folder contains geogrid files, in which default static data at highest available resolution have been used for most variables. These default static data have been downloaded from [wrf user page](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/get_sources_wps_geog.html). The files also contain variables based on 3 new data sets that have been adapted for WPS:

1. **Leaf area index (LAI)** data are based on SPOT satellite data downloaded from [CDS](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-lai-fapar?tab=overview) and processed for use in WPS. Data are monthly mean values over period of 15 years  (i.e. from 1999 to 2014) at 30s resolution.
Decision to use these new data set in the new CORDEX-EUR-11 runs taken in November 2022, is based on the the test run performed by AUTH and the [analysis](./LAI_analysis_map_vs_table.pdf).
NOTE: In winter months, due to the position of the SPOT satellite, missing values appear in the far north of the EUR-11 CORDEX domain. These values are filled with the values from the default LAI map based on MODIS LAI data, also avilable at 30s resolution.
All the details on the preprocessing procedure can be found in the github repository [lai4wrf](https://github.com/AEI-CORDyS/lai4wrf).

2. **Land use data** are based on [CORINE data](https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover) (COoRdination of INformation on the Environment), which is on the higher resolution and more up-to-date than the default MODIS data set. The CORINE data are collected during 2011 and 2012 at 100 m horizontal resolution. Raw CORINE defines more land use classes than the MODIS data set available for WPS, therefore the preparation included (1) re-classification to the MODIS land cover categories to allow a straightforward implementation into WPS, (2) merging the appropriate categories within a Geographic Information System (GIS) software, and (3) the conversion to WPS readable data with [`convert_geotiff`](https://github.com/openwfm/convert_geotiff)’ utility. For more deatails on the procedure please contact Hans-Stefan Bauer from the University of Hohenheim (contact: hans-stefan.bauer@uni-hohenheim.de). <br>The data set covers only Europe, and the missing part outside of Europe, which is within the EUR-11 domain, is filled with the default MODIS data at 15s resolution. 
Black sea in CORINE is categorized as sea, while in "MODIS with lakes" as a lake. The final file is fixed so the coplete Black sea is set to lake category [geogrid_BS2lake](./geo_em.d01_EUR-11_newLAI_BlackSea2lake.nc), or to the sea category [geogrid_BS2sea](./geo_em.d01_EUR-11_newLAI_BlackSea2sea.nc).

3. **Top soil texture data** are based on the global Harmonized World Soil Database v 1.2 at 30s resolution [HWSD](https://www.fao.org/soils-portal/data-hub/soil-maps-and-databases/harmonized-world-soil-database-v12/en/) and Soil Map of Germany 1:1 000 000 [BÜK1000](https://www.bgr.bund.de/DE/Themen/Boden/Informationsgrundlagen/Bodenkundliche_Karten_Datenbanken/BUEK1000/buek1000_node.html) over Germany. These data sets are both adapted from WRF and published ([Milovac et al. 2018](doi:10.1594/WDCC/WRF_NOAH_HWSD_world_TOP_ST_v121); [Milovac et al., 2014](doi:10.1594/WDCC/WRF_NOAH_BUK_Ger_top_SOILTYP)).

Filling the missing data gaps of LAI data and fixing the category for the Black Sea was done using [notebook](./update_static_data.ipynb). All the intemediate geogrid files can be downloaded from the links given in the same notebook.
